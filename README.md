# Welcome to my GIS Portfolio!
A little bit about me: 

I am David Tran, a senior at Boston University studying Earth and Environmental Sciences with a concentration in GIS and Remote Sensing. Much of background in GIS and Remote Sensing
stems from academia, but I have also worked in non-profit organizations such as NECWA, where I did analyses of terrapin populations in ArcGis and flew drones to monitor behavior. 
Many of the maps shown are done in ArcGIS Pro, Python, and QGIS. Regarding remote sensing, I have used tools such as Bash, Google Earth Engine, ENVI, SeaDAS, and Panoply. Outside of academia 
and work, you'll see me
